// ^ Objectives
// * Define what a tree is
// * Compare and contrast trees and lists
// * Explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees
// * Implement operations on binary search trees

// ^ What is a tree?
// * A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
// * Lists are linear, trees are non-linear

// ^ Tree Terminology
// * Root - The top node in a tree
// * Child - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
// * Parent - The converse notion of a child  
// * Siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent
// * Leaf - A node with no children
// * Edge - The connection between one node and another

// ^ Examples
// * HTML DOM
// * Network Routing
// * Abstract Syntax Trees
// * Artificial Intelligence (decision trees)
// * Folders in an operating system

// ^ Kinds of Trees
// * Trees
// * Binary Trees
// * Binary Search Trees

// ^ How BST work
// * Every parent node has at most two children
// * Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
// * Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent

// ^ Big O of BST
// * Insertion - O(log n)
// * Searching - O(log n)
// * Not guaranteed, worst case is O(n)
