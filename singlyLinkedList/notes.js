// ^ Single Linked List

//? Objectives
// * Define what a singly linked list is
// * Compare and contrast linked lists with arrays
// * Implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on singly linked lists

//? What is a linked list?
// * A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property
// * Linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
// * The head is the beginning of the list
// * The tail is the end of the list

//^ Comparisons with arrays
//* Lists
// * Do not have indexes!
// * Connected via nodes with a next pointer
// * Random access is not allowed

//* Arrays
// * Indexed in order!
// * Insertion and deletion can be expensive
// * Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
