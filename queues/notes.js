// ^ Queues

// ^ Objectives
// * Define what a queue is
// * Understand use cases for a queue
// * Implement operations on a queue data structure

// ^ What is a queue?
// * A FIFO data structure! First in, first out
// ? We've seen this before... in the real world!
// * Queues are used everywhere! Think about when you're waiting in line
// * How do we use them in programming?
// * Background tasks
// * Uploading resources

// ^ How do we use them in programming?
// * Background tasks
// * Uploading resources
// * Printing / Task processing

// ^ Big O of Queues
// * Insertion - O(1)
// * Removal - O(1)
// * Searching - O(n)
// * Access - O(n)

// ^ Recap
// * Queues are a FIFO data structure
// * All operations happen in constant time - O(1)
// * queues are used to process tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures
// * Insertion and removal are done in constant time
