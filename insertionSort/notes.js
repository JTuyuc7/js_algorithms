//^ Insertion Sort
// * Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted
// * Start by picking the second element in the array
// * Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
// * Continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion to place the element in the correct place
// * Repeat until the array is sorted

// ^ Insertion Sort Pseudocode
// * Start by picking the second element in the array
// * Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
// * Continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion to place the element in the correct place
// * Repeat until the array is sorted


// ^ Recap
// * Sorting is fundamental
// * Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort are all roughly O(n^2) time complexity
// * All have average time complexity of O(n^2)
// * We can do better... but we need more complex algorithms!
