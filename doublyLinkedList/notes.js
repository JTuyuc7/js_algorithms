// ^ We know what list are... but doubly?
// * Almost identical to singly linked lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous node!

//^ Big O of Doubly Linked Lists
// * Insertion - O(1)
// * Removal - O(1)
// * Searching - O(n) // technically O(n/2) but that's still O(n)
// * Access - O(n)
// * Technically better than singly linked lists!

// * Recap
// * Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to Singly Linked Lists except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes
// * Better than Singly Linked Lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time!
// * However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer
// * More difficult to implement than Singly Linked Lists
